# See also https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4691 which would resolve this.
#
# Notes about past docs versions:
# v0.6 and earlier doc releases: Use the "readfile" shortcodes to nest all README.md files within the _index.md files.
# v0.7 or later doc releases: Rename "README.md" files to "index.md" to avoid unnecessary lower-level _index.md files
#     (and to prevent deeply nested shortcodes ==> double markdown processing issues).
#     The "readfile" shortcodes are still used but only at the top level.
