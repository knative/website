# THIS FILE IS USED BY THE NETLIFY SERVER TO RUN AND PUBLISH DOC BUILDS #
#########################################################################

# By default, builds all docs releases from the knative/docs repo.
# Will also extract PR details from webhooks and then build and publish
# content based on the Fork and Branch of the corresponding PR.

# Create a Netlify build webhook and then add it to your GitHub repo fork
# for continuous builds and PR previews.
# (https://www.netlify.com/docs/webhooks/)

# Requirement: Your fork must include all releases and maintain the same
# branch names and structure as the knative/docs repo. Otherwise, set up
# your build using the flag: BUILDALLRELEASES="FALSE"

# See all options below for configuring this file to work both your own
# knative/website and knative/docs forks and your own personal Netlify
# account (to set up your own doc preview builds).

# Quit on error
set -e

# Retrieve the default docs version
source scripts/docs-version-settings.sh
# Use default repo and branch from docs-version-settings.sh
BRANCH="$DEFAULTBRANCH"
FORK="$DEFAULTFORK"

# Set build default values
BUILDENVIRONMENT="production"
BUILDALLRELEASES="true"
BUILDSINGLEBRANCH="false"
LOCALBUILD="false"
PRBUILD="false"

# Manually specify your fork and branch for all builds.
#
# OPTIONAL: Manually configure your knative/website fork to build from your
#           knative/docs fork by default.
#           (For example, if you have a personal Netlify account and want
#            to easily click the "Deploy" button from the Netlify UI.)
#
#           Example:
#           On the Netlify > Settings > Build & Deploy > Continuous Deployment
#           of your personal account, you can manually set the build command
#           and add include the '-f' and '-b' flags:
#
#           Build command: [./scripts/build.sh -f repofork -b branchname]
