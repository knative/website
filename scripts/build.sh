# MAKE RELATIVE LINKS WORK
# We want users to be able view and use the source files in GitHub as well as on the site.
# Therefore, the following changes need to be made to all docs files prior to Hugo site build.
# Convert GitHub enabled source, into HUGO supported content:
#  - For all 'content/*.md' files:
#    - Skip/assume any Markdown link with fully qualified HTTP(s) URL is 'external'
#    - Otherwise, remove all '.md' file extensions from Markdown links
#    - Replace all "README.md" with "index.html"
#  - For files NOT included using the "readfile" shortcode:
#     (exclude all README.md files from relative link adjustment)
#    - Adjust relative links by adding additional depth:
#      - Convert './' to '../'
#      - Convert '../' to '../../'
#  - Ignore Hugo site related files:
#     - _index.md files (req. Hugo 'section' files)
#     - API shell files (until those API source builds are modified to include frontmatter)
#  - Skip GitHub files:
#    - .git* files
#    - non-docs directories
