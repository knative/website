# Knative STAGING Site Params (adds to (or can override) Site "_default")
# Use STAGING for development, like inflight PR reviews and content testing

# Usage notes:
# To build with these settings, you run: "hugo --environment staging"
# Hugo build then uses every setting defined in "config/_default" and then merge
# all settings defined here for "staging" on top of all those define for "_default".
