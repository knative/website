# To build with these settings, you run: "hugo"
# Also see "production" and "staging" environment settings.

# Ignore files when rendering/building site (to hide from Nav tree and sitemap)
# Add files here that you "include" in other files using the 'readfile' shortcode
#
# Example: Each README.md file (kept so GitHub repo has landing pages) that are "included" 
# (like: {{% readfile file="path-from-root/README.md" markdown="true" %}} in a _index.md file)
# should be hidden from the Hugo build (to avoid blank nav entries and extra sitemap entries).
