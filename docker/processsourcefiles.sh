# Process content in .md files (MAKE RELATIVE LINKS WORK)
# We want users to be able view and use the source files in GitHub as well as on the site.
# Therefore, the following changes need to be made to all docs files prior to Hugo site build.
# Convert GitHub enabled source, into HUGO supported content:
#  - For all Markdown files under the /content/ directory:
#    - Skip all:
#      - Markdown link with fully qualified HTTP(s) URL is 'external'
#      - GitHub file (.git* files)
#      - non-docs directories
#    - Ignore Hugo site related files (avoid "readfile" shortcodes):
#      - _index.md files (Hugo 'section' files)
#      - API shell files (serving-api.md, eventing-contrib-api.md, eventing-api.md)
#    - For all remaining Markdown files:
#      - Remove all '.md' file extensions from within Markdown links "[]()"
#      - For SEO convert README to index:
#       - Replace all in-page URLS from "README.md" to "index.html"
#       - Rename all files from "README.md" to "index.md"
#      - Adjust relative links by adding additional depth:
#       - Exclude all README.md & _index.md files
#       - Convert './' to '../'
#       - Convert '../' to '../../'

# For SEO, dont use "README" in the URL

#
# Notes about past docs versions:
# v0.6 and earlier doc releases: Use the "readfile" shortcodes to nest all README.md files within the _index.md files.
# v0.7 or later doc releases: Rename "README.md" files to "index.md" to avoid unnecessary lower-level _index.md files
#     (and to prevent deeply nested shortcodes ==> double markdown processing issues).
#     The "readfile" shortcodes are still used but only at the top level.
