# Knative Website

This repo contains the [hugo](https://gohugo.io) templates and themes for the
Knative website. Basically, this should contain the formatting for the website,
and [`knative/docs`](https://github.com/knative/docs) should contain the content
for the website.

You can visit [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for making changes.
